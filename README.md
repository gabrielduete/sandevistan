# Sandevistan: My Virtual Library of Software Engineering Studies

My Virtual Library of Software Engineering Studies. This project aims to document all my studies that will be stored on this Notion page. It will be automatically updated whenever I make any changes.

The name of the project was inspired by the Sandevistan Operating System implant from the Cyberpunk 2077 game. It was my favorite implant during my gameplay. This implant can "stop" time and make everything slow, except the user, which is somewhat similar to this project, as if I stopped time to go back and review something I studied and left documented. I was out of ideas for what name to put, and this came to mind.

### Color pallete

The choice of colors was created thinking about both the color palette that I already use as my profile photo, and the colors that reference sandevistan.

Then, colors were selected from the hexadecimal colors `#1A3038` and `#122226`, from which the weakest and strongest colors were generated, composing the same palette.

### UI/UX

I wanted to follow a more minimalist and futuristic idea, so the home is simple, but with a glitch animation, which refers to a futuristic environment.

On the content page, I only used the Raleway font, to be simple to view and with few details, as the aim is to be able to read the items correctly.
